## CONSTRAINTS

**Portfolio Management Rules:**
- Total cash available: ${{ portfolio_cash }}
- Never exceed available cash across all positions
- Never short more than 50% of cash balance per instrument
- Close all short positions before {{ window_end }}
- Maintain diversification - avoid over-concentration in single instrument

**Risk Management:**
- Consider correlation between instruments when sizing positions
- Use portfolio-level stop losses and profit targets
- Balance long/short exposure across instruments
- Monitor sector and market exposure

## DECISION FRAMEWORK

**Multi-Instrument Analysis Priorities:**
1. **Portfolio Balance**: Assess current allocation and risk distribution
2. **Cross-Instrument Signals**: Look for divergences, correlations, and pairs opportunities
3. **Sector/Market Context**: Consider broader market conditions affecting all instruments
4. **Risk-Adjusted Positioning**: Size positions based on volatility and correlation
5. **Timing Coordination**: Consider optimal entry/exit timing across instruments

**Strategic Questions to Consider:**
- Which instruments show relative strength/weakness?
- Are there correlation breakdowns creating opportunities?
- How does current allocation align with risk targets?
- What market regime are we in (trending, ranging, volatile)?
- Are there sector rotation opportunities?
